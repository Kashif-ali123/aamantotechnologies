                                  <h3><u>How AI Chatbot Technology is Changing The Health Industry </u> </h3>
                                  <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>There is no denying that artificial intelligence is having a significant impact on the healthcare industry. According to Accenture research, more than 40% of healthcare executives believe AI will have the most critical influence on their organizations within the next three years. In addition, various types of artificial intelligence, such as predictive analytics or machine learning, are already being used by healthcare practitioners to address multiple concerns.  </p>
                            <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>A growing number of them are looking at chatbots these days. For example, in the medical field, AI-powered chatbots can triage patients and direct them to the right resources. In addition, when people attempt to figure out what's causing their symptoms, chatbots are seen as a more dependable and accurate alternative to online searches. </p>
                            <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Regular people aren't medically trained to recognize the seriousness of their illnesses. This is when chatbots come in handy. They gather basic information from patients, then present them with details about their problems and propose future steps based on that knowledge.  </p>
                            <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>We'll cover everything there is to know about this AI chatbot and how it functions in the healthcare field in this article. As a result, make sure you stick with it to the end.</p>

Every day, it becomes increasingly intertwined with technology, forcing healthcare organizations to rethink their operations. Providing the most outstanding possible care to patients will always be the feature of adequate healthcare. However, when patient expectations shift, healthcare organizations must adapt fast to provide a fully engaged, patient-centred experience.</p>
                                <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}> The following are some of the most valuable aspects of chatbots in healthcare: </p>
                               
                                <h3>1. Anonymity </h3>
                                <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>This is one of the most critical aspects of the healthcare system, as all institutions must ensure their patients feel safe and secure when sharing their data. This will help not only the clients' sensitive data but also the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries' ability to support diverse medical research and drug discoveries. This can be accomplished by using the following methods:</p>
                                <ul style={{color: "#6b6b84", fontSize:"16px", fontWeight:"600px"}}>
                                    <li><p>Investing heavily in chatbot data security</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Giving patients the option of sharing their data</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Detailed information on the fundamentals of data sharing</p></li>
                                </ul>
                              
                                <h3>2. Monitoring</h3>
                                <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Another vital feature that chatbots can improve is the ability to track, analyses, and inform users about health changes, such as changes in physical activity and weight, mental health monitoring, and so on. Furthermore, these processes are totally automated and are updated every time patients update their profiles with new information.</p>
                               
                                <h3>3. Personalization</h3>
                                <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Chatbots can build better communication with clients and be utilized for various reasons if enough health-related information about each individual is recorded. Some chatbot applications, for example, can evaluate the specific measurements of:</p>
                                <ul style={{color: "#6b6b84", fontSize:"16px", fontWeight:"600px"}}>
                                    <li><p>Oxygenation, heart rate, blood pressure, and body measurements are examples of physical indicators (using the mobile sensors)</p></li>

                                    </ul>  
                                <h3>4. Interaction in Real-Time</h3>
                                <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}> This element entails reducing the time it takes to react to a patient's request and complete primary administrative duties, such as booking an appointment. Furthermore, real-time interaction includes sending various notifications and reminders to patients, which is far more time-efficient than sending personal emails manually.</p>
                                <h3> 5. Scalability </h3>
                                <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}> Last but not least, a key feature of chatbots in healthcare is their ability to engage with multiple patients simultaneously. Unlike conventional one-on-one personal online consultations, emails, or phone calls, chatbot healthcare technology enables simple and effective communication optimization between health systems and their patients.</p>
                                <h3>The Benefits of Healthcare Chatbots</h3>
                                <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>According to a recent analysis by PwC, the intelligent virtual assistants (IVA) industry, which includes chatbots, was valued at $3.4 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow significantly.</p>
                                <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Why? For this reason, there are various development drivers. One of the most important parts is the growing use of intelligent virtual assistants (IVAs) in the healthcare sector for patient management and doctor help, as well as conversational AI technologies, which the COVID-19 pandemic breakout has considerably accelerated.</p>
                                <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>But, specifically, what can medical institutions expect from chatbots in the healthcare industry? Here are the primary benefits of using a health chatbot that you should be familiar with.</p>

                                 <h3>2. Booking of an Appointment: </h3>

                                 <h3>3. Significant cost savings: </h3>

                                 <h3>4. Automated billing and payments system: </h3>  
                                 <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>Chatbot technology can also help with medical billing by automating tasks like invoice mailing, payment tracking, and cost collection once a patient visits their doctor.</p>
                                 <h3>5. Controlling the unlimited number of Patients: </h3>
